# Sentiment Analysis Using ZenML

## Description:

* This project implements sentiment analysis using Python and ZenML.
* This project will mainly focus on the development of ML models using ZenML as a part of learning steps in MLOps.
* It leverages object-oriented programming principles and concepts like Abstraction for code organization.
* ZenML is employed to streamline pipeline creation and artifact tracking.
* Version control is maintained using Git and GitHub.

## Key Features:

* Here I am creating a **training_pipeline** which is responsible for training a model and evaluating its performance.
* I have created classes i.e. **steps**, which are responsible for carrying out essential steps required while training a model. For example -  clean_data.py, ingest_data.py
* One can start ML model development by running **run_pipeline.py** which is responsible for running a particular pipeline.

## Getting Started:

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python
    * ZenML
    * Git
2. **Installation:**
    * Create a virtual environment.
    * Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
