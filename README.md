**# Sentiment Analysis Using ZenML**

**Description:**

* This project implements sentiment analysis using Python and ZenML.
* This project will mainly focus on development of ML models using zenml as a part of learning step of MLOps.
* It leverages object-oriented programming principles and concpets like Abstraction for code organization.
* ZenML is employed to streamline pipeline creation and artifact tracking.
* Version control is maintained using Git and GitHub.

**Key Features:**

* here i am creating a training_pipeline which is responsible to train a model and evaluating its performance
* I have created classes i.e steps, which are responsible to carry out essential steps required while training a model. For example- clean_data.py, ingest_data.py
* One can start ML model development by running run_pipeline.py which is responsible to run a particular pipeline.
**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python
    * ZenML
    * Git
2. **Installation:**
    * create a virtual environment
